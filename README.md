1. Just download the two files from the Github repository (hamdash.html and wheelzoom.js) and keep them together on the same folder.
2. Open hamdash.html with any browser of your preference and you done.
3. With any text editor (like Notepad) you can change the source images or the menu options.

Is that easy!
